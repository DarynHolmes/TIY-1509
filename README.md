# Welcome!!!

Can you please make sure you have Ruby installed. 

You can verify this in the console with:
```
$ ruby -v
ruby 2.0.0p645
```

Anything later that 1.9.0 is fine.

You will also need a text editor - sublime is a good choice

We will be using this Trello board - https://trello.com/b/mZn7EBmk/1509

Please sign up to Tello and open that board.
